# Strong typing
Strong typing in TypeScript refers to the practice of explicitly specifying data types for variables, function parameters, and return values throughout your code. This approach offers several benefits:

- Early Error Detection
- Enhanced Readability
- Improved Maintainability
- Type Safety

***In TypeScript, strong typing is enforced through the following mechanisms:***

## 1. Type Annotations:
Explicitly declaring the type of a variable, function parameter, or function return type using a colon (`:`) followed by the type.

## 2. Interfaces:
Defining named sets of properties and their types to describe the shape of an object.

## 3. Type Aliases:
Creating custom names for types, especially useful for complex types or combinations.

## 4. Union Types:
Allowing variables to hold values of multiple specified types.

## 5. Type Inference:
TypeScript's ability to automatically deduce types based on assignments and usage, reducing the need for explicit annotations.

## 6. Type Guards:
Techniques such as `typeof`, `instanceof`, and custom functions to ***narrow down types*** within conditional blocks.
